# PlayrServers QEMU Management Portal (Assume this is garbage, do not use)

A hardened FastAPI application that exposes both a password-protected operator
portal and a machine-to-machine API for orchestrating remote QEMU/KVM
hypervisors. The management UI lives at **https://manage.playrservers.com** and
the automation API at **https://api.playrservers.com**, both operated by the
PlayrServers control plane team. Remote hypervisors run a lightweight agent that
authenticates with this application using a user-scoped API key issued through
the management interface. Each operator owns their agents, SSH credentials, and
audit history; no sensitive material is shared across accounts. Operators using
the portal focus on onboarding hypervisors and agents‚Äîthe hosting
infrastructure is maintained separately by the platform team.

## Key Features

- üîí **Password-protected operator portal** ‚Äì administrators provision accounts
  and operators authenticate via the management UI; self-service registration is
  disabled by default.
- üîê **Per-user API keys** ‚Äì rotate or revoke automation tokens from the portal;
  requests must include the `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header.
- üîë **User-scoped SSH keys** ‚Äì private keys are stored per agent and never
  exposed outside of the owning profile.
- üåê **Remote-only control** ‚Äì the web tier never installs QEMU/libvirt; it only
  talks to remote servers that already provide virtualization.
- üìã **Agent registry** ‚Äì users can register multiple agents (remote hosts)
  including hostnames, SSH ports, and host verification preferences.
- üß† **VM lifecycle API** ‚Äì trigger `start`, `shutdown`, `destroy`, `reboot`, or
  `dominfo` via secure HTTP calls.
- üóÑÔ∏è **SQLite persistence** ‚Äì all profiles, agents, and keys are stored locally
  in `data/management.sqlite3` by default.

## Quick start on Ubuntu 24.04

Run the installer with a **single command** on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 server. The
script installs system dependencies, provisions a Python virtual environment,
creates a systemd service, and (optionally) configures nginx to publish the
management and API endpoints. The CLI emits colorised status banners so you
can track progress at a glance.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlayrTBH/Management/main/scripts/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Already have a clone checked out? Run the same installer locally:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/install.sh
```

Environment variables can tweak the installer without editing the script:

- `APP_REPO` ‚Äì clone/pull from a Git URL instead of copying the current
  directory.
- `APP_DIR` ‚Äì installation directory (default `/opt/manage.playrservers`).
- `APP_DOMAIN` ‚Äì public hostname for the management UI when publishing via nginx (default `manage.playrservers.com`).
- `API_DOMAIN` ‚Äì public hostname for the automation API when publishing via nginx (default `api.playrservers.com`).
- `APP_PORT` ‚Äì internal management UI port (default `8000`).
- `APP_API_PORT` ‚Äì internal API port (default `8001`).
- `APP_API_HOST` ‚Äì bind address for the API service (defaults to `APP_HOST`).
- `INSTALL_NGINX` ‚Äì set to `0` to skip nginx installation.

After installation the `manage-playrservers` systemd unit supervises both
services: the management UI listens on port `8000` and the public API listens on
port `8001`, binding to all interfaces by default. You can reach the UI directly
from your LAN using the server's IP address (for example,
`http://192.168.1.212:8000`). Expose `https://manage.playrservers.com` by
routing requests to the management port and map
`https://api.playrservers.com` to the API port. Ensure TLS certificates cover
both hostnames before exposing them to the internet.

Provision operator accounts from the server; self-registration is disabled:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/create_user.py "Alice Ops" alice@example.com
```

The script prompts for a password and prints the initial API key once (store it
securely; subsequent rotations occur from the web portal).

## Updating an existing deployment

Fetch the latest code, refresh Python dependencies, and restart the service without touching your SQLite data (so configured users and hypervisor connections remain intact):

```bash
sudo -u playrmanager git -C /opt/manage.playrservers pull --ff-only && sudo -u playrmanager /opt/manage.playrservers/.venv/bin/pip install -r /opt/manage.playrservers/requirements.txt && sudo systemctl restart manage-playrservers
```

## Configuration

The application stores its data in SQLite and exposes configuration through
environment variables:

| Environment Variable      | Description                                                   | Default                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `MANAGEMENT_DB_PATH`      | Custom path to the SQLite database                            | `data/management.sqlite3`      |
| `MANAGEMENT_HOST`         | Bind address for the management UI                            | `0.0.0.0`                      |
| `MANAGEMENT_PORT`         | Listen port for the management UI                             | `8000`                         |
| `MANAGEMENT_API_HOST`     | Bind address for the API service                              | matches `MANAGEMENT_HOST`      |
| `MANAGEMENT_API_PORT`     | Listen port for the API service                               | `8001`                         |
| `MANAGEMENT_WORKERS`      | Number of uvicorn worker processes                            | `1`                            |
| `MANAGEMENT_RELOAD`       | Set to `true`/`1` to enable auto-reload (development only)    | `false`                        |
| `MANAGEMENT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | External URL advertised to agents via the portal             | `https://api.playrservers.com` |
| `MANAGEMENT_SESSION_SECRET` | Secret used to sign management sessions (must be set)        | generated by installer         |
| `MANAGEMENT_SESSION_SECURE` | Enforce HTTPS-only session cookies (`false` for local dev)    | `true`                         |

The systemd unit installed by `scripts/install.sh` sources `/etc/manage-playrservers.env`
(if present) so you can persist environment overrides there.

## Management interface

Navigate to `https://manage.playrservers.com` (or the hostname assigned by your
platform team) to access the operator portal. Accounts are created
with `scripts/create_user.py` and authenticate with an email + password. The UI
exposes three primary workflows:

- **Dashboard** ‚Äì high-level overview of the deployment, including the API base
  URL that remote agents should target when connecting to the control plane.
- **Account &amp; API key** ‚Äì update profile information, rotate credentials, and
  copy onboarding snippets for the remote agent.
- **Hypervisor management** ‚Äì register virtualization hosts, inspect their
  virtual machines, dispatch lifecycle commands, and launch SSH sessions with
  the stored credentials. A deployment guide placeholder highlights where the
  remote agent documentation will live.

Session cookies are signed with `MANAGEMENT_SESSION_SECRET` and marked
`Secure`/`SameSite=Lax` so they are only transmitted over HTTPS.

## API Overview

The automation endpoints live on the dedicated API service (default port `8001`).
When exposing `https://api.playrservers.com`, route that host to the API port so
public requests continue to use simple paths (e.g. `/health`, `/agents`). Every endpoint
except `/health` requires an API key presented in the `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header.

### Health

| Method | Path      | Description            |
| ------ | --------- | ---------------------- |
| GET    | `/health` | Service readiness ping |

### User & API key management

| Method | Path                     | Description                                    |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/users/me`              | Return the authenticated user's profile        |
| POST   | `/users/me/api-key/rotate` | Issue a new API key for the current user      |

User accounts are created by administrators via `scripts/create_user.py`; the
API does not expose a self-registration endpoint.

### Agent registry

| Method | Path                               | Description                                   |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/agents`                          | List the caller's registered agents           |
| POST   | `/agents`                          | Register a new agent / virtualization host    |
| GET    | `/agents/{id}`                     | Retrieve metadata for a specific agent        |
| GET    | `/agents/{id}/credentials`         | Retrieve the agent's stored SSH key material  |
| PATCH  | `/agents/{id}`                     | Update agent metadata or credentials          |
| DELETE | `/agents/{id}`                     | Remove an agent                               |

Agent registration payload example:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.playrservers.com/agents \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "name": "dalek-hypervisor",
        "hostname": "192.0.2.15",
        "port": 22,
        "username": "qemu-admin",
        "private_key": "-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
        "allow_unknown_hosts": false
      }'
```

### VM lifecycle operations

All VM operations are scoped to an agent identifier and require authentication.
Responses include the executed command, exit status, stdout, and stderr.

| Method | Path                                                | Description                         |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/agents/{id}/vms`                                  | List VMs visible to the agent       |
| GET    | `/agents/{id}/vms/{vm}`                             | `virsh dominfo` for a VM            |
| POST   | `/agents/{id}/vms/{vm}/start`                       | Start a VM                          |
| POST   | `/agents/{id}/vms/{vm}/shutdown`                    | Gracefully shut down a VM           |
| POST   | `/agents/{id}/vms/{vm}/force-stop`                  | Force stop (`virsh destroy`)        |
| POST   | `/agents/{id}/vms/{vm}/reboot`                      | Reboot a VM                         |

## Operational Notes

- Ensure SSH private keys uploaded to the portal are dedicated to the target
  hypervisors and protected with strong passphrases.
- The management host does **not** install QEMU/libvirt. Agents run on the
  virtualization servers themselves and expose access over SSH to `virsh`.
- Ensure TLS termination protects API credentials in transit.
- Restrict network access to the management host; this portal is for personal
  use and is not meant for a public audience.
- Back up `data/management.sqlite3` regularly to preserve user profiles and
  agent definitions.

## Development

Create a virtual environment and install requirements locally:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
MANAGEMENT_RELOAD=true python main.py
```

Use `scripts/create_user.py` (or import `Database` in a REPL) to create a user
locally. The management UI is reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or via your
machine's LAN IP) and the API on `http://127.0.0.1:8001`; target the API base
with the issued key to exercise the endpoints during development. When testing
over plain HTTP you can set `MANAGEMENT_SESSION_SECURE=false` to allow the
browser to retain the login session.
